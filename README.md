# UK Development

The start of something.

## Notes

- This will be the home page at some point. Don't worry about it for now as the format of this page will change before we publish anything.

### Adding Additional Pages

- Create a new markdown file (use file extension `.md`) in the `docs` directory.
- If you want to group them in a subdirectory within the `docs` folder, that's ok.
- Don't put new pages outside of the `docs` folder.

### Adding Images

- Save file in the `assets` folder
- Link to the file with this format

```
![Image Name](./assets/fileName.fileExtension)
```

### Updating the Sidenav

- Open the `_sidebar.md` file.
- Add a hyperlink to the file location with this format

```
[Link Name]('./docs/fileName.md)
```
